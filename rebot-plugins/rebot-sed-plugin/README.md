# ReBot Sed plugin

This plugin is not useful in fact when using Telegram, because Telegram allows you to edit your sent message.

Every new message sent, the last one is saved on cache, and, if you need to modify something in your last message
you can use this sed plugin for fun, it works like the usual sed command used in the terminal, the available options are:

 - s/wrong/fixed/ - replace only the first occurrences
 - s/wrong/fixed/g - replace all occurrences
